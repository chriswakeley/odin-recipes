    <h2 class="title subsection">Description</h2>
    <p>This is a cheap and easy side dish that comes out tasting like sweet potato fries.  Frozen, diced sweet potatoes are less than half the cost of pre-packaged sweet potato fries, and as an additional bonus, making them from scratch allows you to control the type of oil used.  Baking the sweet potatoes avoids the hassle of deep-frying, and depending on the amount of oil used, can also reduce the calories of the dish.</p>

    <h2 class="title subsection">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup oil of choice</li>
        <li>2 frozen bags of diced sweet potatoes</li>
        <li>Salt and seasoning of choice (I prefer just a bit of garlic powder)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="title subsection">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cover a half baking sheet with a layer of foil, then parchment paper</li>
        <li>Spread bags of sweet potatoes across sheet</li>
        <li>Add oil and mix with potatoes (you can use less oil if you want, but final potatoes will be more toasty than crispy)</li>
        <li>Place sheet in middle of cold oven, then set temp to 400F and bake for 1:30 hours, stirring once at halfway point.</li>
        <li>Once potatoes are cooked, toss with salt and seasoning of choice</li>
    </ol>
