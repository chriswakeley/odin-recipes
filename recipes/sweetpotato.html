    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a cheap and easy side dish that comes out tasting like sweet potato fries.  Frozen, diced sweet potatoes are less than half the cost of pre-packaged sweet potato fries, and as an additional bonus, making them from scratch allows you to control the type of oil used.  Baking the sweet potatoes avoids the hassle of deep-frying, and depending on the amount of oil used, can also reduce the calories of the dish.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup oil of choice</li>
        <li>2 frozen bags of diced sweet potatoes</li>
        <li>Salt and seasoning of choice (I prefer just a bit of garlic powder)</li>
    </ul>
