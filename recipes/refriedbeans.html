    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I use this recipe when I want to make a large batch of a palatable, healthy, and cheap side dish.  Sometimes I blend the beans once they're cooked, and sometimes I leave them whole depending on what sort of texture I'm in the mood for.  After cooking and storing the beans in the fridge, prepping them simply requires microwaving for a few minutes, which makes them a convenient, and time-efficient way to add fiber/carbs/and protein to meals.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Half cup of oil</li>
        <li>2 chopped red onions</li>
        <li>5 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp cumin</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp paprika</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp chilli powder</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp Maggi chicken powder</li>
        <li>1lb dried beans of choice (Black, Red, Pinto)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the dried beans</li>
        <li>Begin to saute the onions on medium heat</li>
        <li>After a couple minutes add the garlic, this is also a good time to start boiling a kettle-full of water to be added later</li>
        <li>When the onions and garlic have browned, add bay leaves, cumin, paprika, chilli powder, and Maggi.  Saute 2 minutes</li>
        <li>Add the beans and kettle-full of <em>now</em> boiling water.  Stir everything together</li>
        <li>Bring pot to boil, then reduce to simmer</li>
        <li>Let simmer for around 3 hours, stirring every 20 minutes, and adding more  boiling water when water level drops below beans</li>
        <li>At this point, you can reduce the mixture to dry-ness of your liking, and optionally blend everything to a paste, or leave as whole beans</li>
    </ol>
