    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I use this recipe when I want to make a large batch of a palatable, healthy, and cheap side dish.  Sometimes I blend the beans once they're cooked, and sometimes I leave them whole depending on what sort of texture I'm in the mood for.  After cooking and storing the beans in the fridge, prepping them simply requires microwaving for a few minutes, which makes them a convenient, and time-efficient way to add fiber/carbs/and protein to meals.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Half cup of oil</li>
        <li>2 chopped red onions</li>
        <li>5 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp cumin</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp paprika</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp chilli powder</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp Maggi chicken powder</li>
        <li>1lb dried beans of choice (Black, Red, Pinto)</li>
    </ul>
