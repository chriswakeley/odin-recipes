    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I use this recipe for breakfast and lunch most days.  It's cheap, easy, can be made ahead of time, and can be varied based on toppings and sauces.  Using frozen chicken increases the convenience of this recipe since you don't have to worry about spoilage, and consequently, cooking large batches of chicken in one go and refrigeration.  On the other hand, cooking large batches of chicken at once eliminates the need to cook anything in order to assemble the wrap, although this requires more planning </p>
    
    <p>My favorite tortillas for wrapping the chicken are El Milagro corn tortillas which can be purchased from most latin markets.  If you've never tried them, they can have a funny smell fresh out of the bag, which fortunately disappears after toasting.  The corn flavor is <strong>superior</strong> to any shelf-stable, grocery store corn tortilla.</p>
