# odin-recipes
This is a basic site constructed with HTML and CSS consisting of a home page and 3 linked recipe pages.

This project demonstrates knowledge of the structure of html files, and several html elements, including links, lists, and images.  It also demonstrates basic CSS skills such as the use of a variety of selectors, styling of several HTML elements. Additionally, the project allowed me to practice the git workflow of staging changes, committing, writing effective commit messages, and pushing to Github.
