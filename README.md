# odin-recipes
This is a basic, HTML-only, site consisting of a home page and 3, linked recipe pages.

This project demonstrates knowledge of the structure of html files, and several html elements, including links, lists, and images.  Additionally, the project allowed me to practice the git workflow of staging changes, committing, writing effective commit messages, and pushing to Github.
